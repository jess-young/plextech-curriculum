# HTML/CSS Introduction
This project will guide you through how you can use HTML to build web pages. 

## Structure of HTML
The majority of your HTML documents will be made up of tags, which are used to denote HTML elements and define where they are on your page.

In all of the HTML that you will encounter, you will need to add the following tags to begin writing your document:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Used to define the language that is used. The `html` attribute can be changed to use older languages (like HTML4 or XHTML), but for the vast majority of things that you will be doing, this tag will remain the same.
- `<html>`: Used to define the beginning of the HTML code. This is where `<head>` and `<body>` will be nested.
- `<head>`: Used to define the metadata for the document. This is where you would add the title or favicon.
- `<body>`: Used to define the contents of your HTML document. This is where the majority of your code will be.

All together, this is what your HTML documents will look like:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        ...
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
```
